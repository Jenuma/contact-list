# contact-list
An example project for becoming familiar with MEAN stack.

It currently features the ability to list all contacts (name/email address/phone number) from a MongoDB data source. Additionally, you can add a new contact and it will populate the list immediately.

In the future, the app should support the ability to edit and delete contacts, and possibly more beyond that. Based on a YouTube tutorial that I will like when I feel like it another day.

## Running the App Locally
1. Clone the repo to your destination of choice.
2. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to contact-list and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Install MongoDB if you haven't already.
5. Run an instance of mongod.exe on localhost at port 27017 (default address).
6. Navigate to the server folder and run `node server`.
7. Navigate to localhost:3000 to load the client.
