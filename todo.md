# TODO

Since I'm not using any sort of task board for this simple project, I'm going to log stories here.

## Features

I would like the ability to edit contacts.

I would like the ability to delete contacts.

The application should do some validation on the data, maybe client and server both.

I should be able to hit `return` instead of having to click on the add button.

## Style

I would like the application to look better.

The list items shouldn't animate on load; only new contacts should animate.

## Testing

I would like to be able to more clearly see test results.  
Karma does not specify the names of the tests as they pass or fail.  
Jasmine-node does, but I would like it to be uniform with Karma.

## Building

I would like the ability to bundle all of my scripts and stylesheets, and minify them.
